### AI/ML Agents in Unity Exploration
This repository documents my exploration into training AI/ML agents within the Unity environment using ML-Agents.

The project currently features examples of training agents to perform basic navigation tasks:

- Rollerball Agent: Trained to roll towards a designated target.
- Car Agent: Trained to drive towards a designated target.

This serves as a starting point for understanding and implementing reinforcement learning techniques for agent control in Unity.
